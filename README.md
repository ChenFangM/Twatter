## Description
REST Cafe is a cute and comforting study website with a radio, to-do lists, Pomodoro timers, coffee, Dad jokes, and more (inspired by [Lofi Cafe](https://www.lofi.cafe/)). We intend to have a homepage and destress tab accessible to logged-in users and passerbys; this includes the radio, pomodoro timer, random jokes and cat pictures to make studying less tedious. Specific features like the to-do list and a profile tab will require signing up and logging in to access. This way, returning users will be able to access their to-do list and modify it as long as they're logged in. Our website incorporates function, focus, and fun (FFF) to make sure you'll bookmark us for the next time you're last-minute studying.
